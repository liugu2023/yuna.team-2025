## About the Association

The Yanshan University Student Net Information Association (YUNA) is a student organization dedicated to promoting computer science and technology at Yanshan University. The association provides a wide platform for learning and practice, covering areas such as web development, cybersecurity, server operations, and high-performance computing. Our mission is to foster technical talent, enhance students' skills, and support their professional development.

## Major Departments

- **Development Department**: The core work of this department is web development, but it also covers other areas of computer science. We offer training in front-end and back-end development and promote innovative projects beyond traditional systems. We also have extensive experience in server operations, high-performance computing, and system design.

  - **Web Development**: Members can learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web frameworks (such as Flask, Django) while participating in personal or school-based projects. We focus not only on traditional management systems but also on creative projects.

  - **Server Operations**: The development department maintains the association's "YunRen" server, which runs the PVE virtualization platform with Ubuntu, Windows Server, and other systems. This server supports projects like cloud note services, campus VPN services, and the 503 Hub IoT platform, offering members practical technical experience.

  - **High-Performance Computing and Systems**: We work closely with the High-Performance Computing Cluster Management team of the School of Information. We encourage students interested in computational optimization, operating systems, and compiler studies to join and explore these cutting-edge areas together.

- **Cybersecurity Department**: The Cybersecurity Department focuses on cybersecurity training and competition organization, covering various areas of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, including Misc, Crypto, Web Security, Reverse Engineering, Pwn, and Android Security. We help members build foundational knowledge in cybersecurity, hone their practical skills, and participate in various national and international cybersecurity competitions.

  - **CTF Competitions**: We offer opportunities for students passionate about cybersecurity and CTF to compete and learn. Through challenges like Misc and Crypto, members can develop the ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, and many have already won awards in competitions.

- **Operations Department**: This department assists the university's IT center with server management, ensuring the stability of critical infrastructure.

- **Publicity Department**: Responsible for promotional materials.
